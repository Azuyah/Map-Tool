Map Tool is a tool created to ease the navigation and creation of map files and folders.

Use the search function to easily open a project folder using the license plate -or other identifer- where you have saved your files.

Use the create function to create a ready-to-use folder in the correct location, with the appropriate names and sub-folders for your project.

Set your desired location for your folders using the "Settings" and "File Path" buttons in the main window.


File Paths:

1. File paths must always be written with forward slashes "/" and not backward slashes "\" or the program cannot find the correct directory.
2. File path must begin and end with a forward slash.
3. If the path contains special letters it may not function properly, if so, replace the special character with a regular one.


Searching:

1. The search function is case-sensitive so make sure you type the folder name exactly as it is named.
2. If you leave the search box empty it will open the main folder of that vehicle brand.

Creating:

1. If you leave the ECU and TCU checkboxes blank the program will create read/write folders directly in the new folder you're creating.
2. The program will always create one "read" and one "write" folder in each path, wheter you select ECU, TCU, both or none.


End.
